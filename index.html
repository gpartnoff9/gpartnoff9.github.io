      <h2>About Greg</h2>
      <p>
        With decades of hands-on experience, I founded <strong>MrfixitallOC</strong> to serve homeowners with skilled, reliable, and honest handyman services. As a <strong>State-Certified Journeyman Carpenter</strong> and <strong>OSHA 10 Certified</strong> technician, I’ve helped countless clients restore, repair, and upgrade their homes with confidence. Whether it’s a quick fix or a complex repair, I bring precision, professionalism, and a can-do attitude to every job.

      <h2>Christ-Centered Values</h2>
      <p>
        At MrfixitallOC, my mission goes beyond fixing what's broken — it's about serving with excellence, integrity, and love. I believe every job, no matter how small, is a chance to glorify God and serve others well.
        As it is written:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-left: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #27ae60; padding-left: 1rem;">
        “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.”<br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">– Colossians 3:23 (ESV)</span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Whether I'm repairing a light fixture or remodeling a space, my goal is to bring peace, order, and care into every home — because that’s how Jesus served others.
